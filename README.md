## About headless-xfce4
This docker image deploys an xfce4 desktop in a container with Alpine Linux.\
It can be used to do basic desktop stuff, however due to the nature of VNC it performs poorly on video playback.

You can install this for example on a VPS in a datacenter, and build an SSH tunnel to access a desktop on a remote machine.\
I recommend to not port forward VNC, rather use a VPN tunnel to access it.
# headless-xfce4

9. (Optional) Install themes and missing icons by opening a terminal in your VNC session and running:\

10. (Optional) Change your VNC password by running this inside your VNC session: (You'll be prompted for a new password)\
`x11vnc -storepasswd ~/.vnc/passwd`
